If you don't want to lose all your settings, Simply copy the
contents of "PlasticCodeWrap_FASMW.ini" and replace/add the
old "[color]" Ini section in your original "FASM.ini" file.

If you have no special settings that you need to keep, you
can simply delete your old "FASM.ini" and  replace it with
"PlasticCodeWrap_FASMW.ini", then rename it to "FASM.ini".
